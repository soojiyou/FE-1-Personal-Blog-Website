                    <p>
                        Pomeranians are small dogs weighing 1.36–3.17 kilograms (3.0–7.0 lb) and standing 8–14 inches
                        (20–36 cm) high at the withers. They are compact but sturdy dogs with an abundant textured
                        coat with a highly plumed tail set high and flat.[3] The top coat forms a ruff of fur on the
                        neck, which Poms are well known for, and they also have a fringe of feathery hair on the
                        hindquarters.</p>
                    <p>
                        The earliest examples of the breed were white or occasionally brown or black. Queen Victoria
                        adopted a small red Pomeranian in 1888, which caused that color to become fashionable by the end
                        of the 19th century. In modern times, the Pomeranian comes in the widest variety of colors of
                        any dog breed, including white, black, brown, red, orange, cream, blue, sable, black and tan,
                        brown and tan, spotted, brindle, and parti, plus combinations of those colors. The most
                        common colors are orange, black, or cream/white.</p>
                    <p>
                        The merle Pomeranian is a recent colour developed by breeders. It is a combination of a solid
                        base colour with a lighter blue/grey patch which gives a mottled effect. The most common base
                        colours for the effect are red/brown or black, although it can also appear with other colours.
                        Combinations such as brindle merle or liver merle are not accepted in the breed standard. In
                        addition, the eye, nose and paw pad are marshmallow color, changing parts of the eye to blue and
                        the color on the nose and paw pads to become mottled pink and black.</p>
                    <p>
                        Pomeranians have a thick double coat. While grooming is not difficult, breeders recommend that
                        it be done daily to maintain the quality of the coat and because of its thickness and the
                        constant shedding, with trimming every 1–2 months. The outer coat is long, straight, and harsh
                        in texture while the undercoat is soft, thick and short. The coat knots and tangles easily,
                        particularly when the undercoat is being shed, which happens twice a year. <b>(All paragraphs
