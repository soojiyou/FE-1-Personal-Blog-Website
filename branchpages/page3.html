                        The life expectancy of a Pomeranian is 12 to 16 years. A well-bred dog
                        on
                        a good diet with appropriate exercise will have few health problems; if kept trim and fit, the
                        Pomeranian is a sturdy dog. The breed does have similar health issues to many other dog
                        breeds,
                        although some issues such as hip dysplasia are uncommon because of the Pomeranian's lightweight
                        build. Some health issues can develop as a result of lack of attention to grooming and
                        teeth-,
                        ear-, and eye-cleaning. With routine care, these problems can be avoided. They are prone to
                        early tooth loss, and dry food is recommended. Poms are one of the breeds with the smallest
                        average litter size, with various sources giving numbers of between 1.9 and 2.7 puppies per
                        litter.</p>

                    <h8>Common problems</h8>
                    <hr>
                    <p>
                        Merle-colored dogs may have mild to severe deafness, blindness, increased intraocular pressure,
                        ametropia, microphthalmia, and colobomas. Merle dogs born from parents who are also both merles
                        may
                        additionally have abnormalities of the skeletal, cardiac and reproductive systems.</p>
                    <p>
                        Luxating patella is another health issue in the Pomeranian breed. It occurs when, either
                        through
                        malformation or trauma, the ridges forming the patellar groove in the knee are not prominent and
                        are
                        too shallow to allow the patella to properly sit securely. This can cause the patella to
                        "luxate"
                        (jump out of the groove) sideways, which will cause the leg to lock up with the foot off the
                        ground. While the muscles are contracted the patella cannot return to the correct position.
                        The
                        initial pain is caused by the knee cap sliding across the ridges of the femur. Once out of
                        position,
                        the dog does not feel any pain caused by the slipped bone.</p>
                    <p>
                        Tracheal collapse is caused by a weakening of the tracheal rings in the windpipe. It occurs when
                        the
                        rings that normally hold the shape of the windpipe collapse, closing the airway. The symptoms of
                        a
                        collapse include a honking cough that can sound similar to a goose honk, an intolerance to
                        exercise,
                        fainting spells and a cough that is worsened by hot weather, exercise and excitement. The
                        tendency for episodes of tracheal collapse typically increases in frequency and severity as the
                        dog
                        ages.</p>
                    <p>
                        In Pomeranians, a condition often called "black skin disease" occurs which is a combination of
                        alopecia (hair loss) and hyperpigmentation (a darkening of the skin). Other names for this
                        condition include woolly coat, coat funk, pseudo-Cushing's disease, or severe hair loss
                        syndrome.
                        This condition affects male Pomeranians more than females, and may be inherited. Although
                        most
                        affected dogs show signs following puberty, it can occur at any age. Other conditions can mimic
                        this
                        condition including Cushing's syndrome, hypothyroidism, chronic skin infections, and
                        reproductive
                        hormone disorders.</p>
                    <p>
                        Another common disorder in male Pomeranians is cryptorchidism. This is when either one or
                        both
                        of the testicles do not descend into the scrotum. It is treated through surgical removal of
                        the
                        retained testicle.</p>

                    <h8>Exercise</h8>
                    <hr>
                    <p>
                        The Pomeranian is a small but energetic breed of dog. Although Pomeranians benefit from frequent
                        attention, they need relatively little exercise: it is recommended to take them on several daily
                        walks and let them run around an enclosed space.</p>
