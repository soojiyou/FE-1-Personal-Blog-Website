                    <h8>Origin</h8>
                    <hr>
                    <p>
                        The Pomeranian is considered to be descended from the German Spitz. The breed is thought to
                        have acquired its name by association with the area known as Pomerania which is located in
                        northern Poland and Germany along the Baltic Sea. Although not the origin of the breed, this
                        area is credited with the breeding which led to the original Pomeranian type of dog. Proper
                        documentation was lacking until the breed's introduction into the United Kingdom.
                    </p>
                    <p>An early modern recorded reference to the Pomeranian breed is from 2 November 1764, in a diary
                        entry in James Boswell's Boswell on the Grand Tour: Germany and Switzerland. "The Frenchman had
                        a Pomeranian dog named Pomer whom he was mighty fond of." The offspring of a Pomeranian and
                        a wolf bred by an animal merchant from London is discussed in Thomas Pennant's A Tour in
                        Scotland from 1769.</p>
                    <p>
                        Two members of the British Royal Family influenced the evolution of the breed. In 1767, Queen
                        Charlotte, Queen-consort of King George III of Great Britain, brought two Pomeranians to
                        England.</p>
                    <p>
                        Named Phoebe and Mercury, the dogs were depicted in paintings by Sir Thomas Gainsborough. These
                        paintings depicted a dog larger than the modern breed, reportedly weighing as much as 30–50 lb
                        (14–23 kg), but showing modern traits such as the heavy coat, ears and a tail curled over the
                        back.</p>
                    <p>
                        Queen Victoria, Queen Charlotte's granddaughter, was also an enthusiast and established a large
                        breeding kennel. One of her favoured dogs was a comparatively small red sable Pomeranian which
                        she possibly named "Windsor's Marco" and was reported to weigh only 12 lb (5.4 kg). When she
                        first exhibited Marco in 1891, it caused the smaller-type Pomeranian to become immediately
                        popular and breeders began selecting only the smaller specimens for breeding. During her
                        lifetime, the size of the Pomeranian breed was reported to have decreased by 50%. Queen
                        Victoria worked to improve and promote the Pomeranian breed by importing smaller Pomeranians
                        of different colours from various European countries to add to her breeding program. Royal
                        owners during this period also included Joséphine de Beauharnais, the wife of Napoleon I of
                        France, and King George IV of the United Kingdom.</p>
                    <p>
                        The first breed club was set up in England in 1891, and the first breed standard was written
                        shortly afterwards. The first member of the breed was registered in the United States to the
                        American Kennel Club in 1898, and it was recognized in 1900.</p>
                    <p>
                        In 1912, two Pomeranians were among only three dogs to survive the sinking of RMS Titanic. A
                        Pomeranian called "Lady", owned by Miss Margaret Hays, escaped with her owner in lifeboat number
                        seven, while Elizabeth Barrett Rothschild took her pet to safety with her in lifeboat number
                        six.</p>
                    <p>
                        Glen Rose Flashaway won the Toy Group at the Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show in 1926, the first
                        Pomeranian to win a group at Westminster. It would take until 1988 for the first Pomeranian,
                        "Great Elms Prince Charming II", to win the Best in Show prize from the Westminster Kennel
                        Club.</p>
                    <p>
                        In the standard published in 1998, the Pomeranian is included in the German Spitz standard,
                        along with the Keeshond, by the Fédération Cynologique Internationale. According to the
                        standard "Spitz breeds are captivating" and have a "unique characteristic, cheeky
                        appearance."</p>
                    <h8>Popularity</h8>
                    <hr>
                    <p>The Pomeranian has been among the more popular dog breeds in the United States, featuring
                        consistently in the top 20 of registered American Kennel Club dog breeds since at least 1998,
                        when
                        it was ranked #10; the breed was #17 in the 2011 rankings, dropping two spots from the previous
                        year. In 2012 and 2013 it remained in the top twenty and was ranked at #19. In 2015, the
                        breed fell to #21, falling further to #22 in both 2016 and 2017.</p>
                    <p>
                        It is not listed in the top 20 breeds in the UK in either 2007 or 2008. In Australia their
                        popularity has declined since 1986, with a peak of 1,128 Pomeranians registered with the
                        Australian
                        National Kennel Council in 1987; only 577 were registered in 2008. However, this is an increase
                        from
                        2004, when only 491 dogs were registered. It is recognised that the common Pomeranian is listed
                        as
                        the 27th most intelligent dog with the German Shepherd sitting at no 1. </p>
                    <p>
                        It is more popular in American cities in 2008, ranking joint tenth (with the American Bulldog)
                        in
                        Detroit and Orlando, ninth in Los Angeles, a joint seventh in Seattle (again, with
                        the
                        American Bulldog), but third in Honolulu, only bested by the Labrador Retriever and the
                        German
                        Shepherd.</p>
