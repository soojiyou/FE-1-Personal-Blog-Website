                    <h2>About Pomeranian</h2>
                    <p>
                        The <b>Pomeranian</b> (often known as a <b>Pom</b>) is a <a
                            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dog_breed">breed</a> of dog of the <a
                            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spitz">Spitz</a> type that is
                        named for the
                        Pomerania region in north-west Poland and north-east Germany in Central Europe. Classed as a toy
                        dog breed because of its small size, the Pomeranian is descended from larger Spitz-type dogs,
                        specifically the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_Spitz">German Spitz</a>. It has
                        been determined by the Fédération Cynologique
                        Internationale to be part of the German Spitz breed; and in many countries, they are known as
                        the <b>Zwergspitz</b> ("Dwarf Spitz").</p>
                    <p>
                        The breed has been made popular by a number of royal owners since the 18th century. <a
                            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queen_Victoria">Queen
                            Victoria</a> owned a particularly small Pomeranian and consequently, the smaller variety
                        became
                        universally popular. During Queen Victoria's lifetime alone, the size of the breed decreased
                        by
                        half. Overall, the Pomeranian is a sturdy, healthy dog. The most common health issues are
                        luxating patella and tracheal collapse. More rarely, the breed can have Alopecia X, a skin
                        condition colloquially known as "black skin disease". This is a genetic disease which causes
                        the
                        dog's skin to turn black and lose all or most of its hair.[1] As of 2017, in terms of
                        registration figures, since at least 1998, the breed has ranked among the top fifty most
                        popular
                        breeds in the United States, and the current fashion for small dogs has increased their
                        popularity worldwide.
